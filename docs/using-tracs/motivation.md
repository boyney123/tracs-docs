I think its fair to say that most engineering teams want to be better tomorrow than they were today, but normally the only way to get better is to measure how we are doing and aim to improve those metrics over time. We can only get better if we measure what we do.

But knowing what to measure and what to change can be quite the challange. 


This project was built to help software teams measure metrics that according to the book: [Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations ](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07B9F83WM/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) can move teams from low performing to high performing teams.

### Inspired by Research

After reading __Accelerate__ I wanted an easy way to capture these metrics myself and for my team and decided to open source a solution that can help others too.

__Tracs__ is an open source tool that was inspired by __Accelerate__ that hopefully allows developers, teams and organisations to start measuring key metrics that can really transform teams.
